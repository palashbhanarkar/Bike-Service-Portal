# Bike Service Portal

## Project Summary
Bike Service Portal is a web-based application designed to digitize bike service center operations by replacing manual workflows with a structured, role-based system.

## Solution Overview
The application manages the complete service flow, from appointment booking to payment handling. To compare backend development approaches, the same system was implemented using two technology stacks:
- Java with Spring MVC and Hibernate
- C# with .NET

Both implementations follow identical functional requirements and business logic.

## Key Features
- Role-based access for multiple user types
- CRUD operations for customers, vehicles, and service records
- Backend APIs supporting end-to-end workflows
- Relational database integration for data persistence

## Technologies Used
- Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate  
- C#, .NET Framework  
- Oracle Database  
- REST APIs  
- HTML, CSS, JSON  

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Full-stack web application development
- Backend API and database design
- Applying MVC architecture and object-oriented principles
- Implementing the same system across multiple frameworks
